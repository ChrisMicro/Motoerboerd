## WHAT ?
DC Motor driven sound device

You can produce power with a little DC-Motor by just turning it by hand.
With this power you can supply a sound circuit that makes intersting sounds.

## WHY ?

Just for fun or aducational workshops to show children how power can be produced.

## How ?

You need good motors made for higher voltages ( e.g. 24V ) to produce enought power with your hands.

It might be intersting to watch the frequency specturm on you PC or mobile phone.
